# Online Bookstore System

Overview
This project presents the analysis and design of an Online Bookstore System.
The focus of the project is on software engineering concepts and UML modeling rather than code implementation.

The system allows customers to browse and purchase books online, while administrators manage books, inventory, and system data. External services such as payment processing and email notifications are included at the design level.
